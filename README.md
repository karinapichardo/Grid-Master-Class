# Grid-Master-Class

#### Recreated the “Grid Master Class” website, designed by Webflow using only HTML5 and CSS3.

I loved working on this project, it allowed me to further grasp my understanding of CSS grid. 

My entire layout for this website was created with CSS grid, super awesome. Best part about it is that it’s also responsive!

This project really showed me the power that CSS grid has, it’s almost as if the sky is the limit with the layouts you’re able to create.

I look forward to continuing my usage of CSS grid and seeing all the wonderful layouts I implement!
